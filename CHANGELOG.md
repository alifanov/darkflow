## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-20

### Installer
- **`darkflow-run.sh --watch [seconds]`** — foreground loop mode; runs dispatch every N seconds (default 900) in the terminal without requiring launchd or cron. Safe to run alongside a system scheduler (lock prevents concurrent dispatches). Minimum interval: 60 s.

### Docs
- **`routines/README.md`** — added "Running in the foreground (watch mode)" section with `--watch` usage, tmux example, and note on concurrency.

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-20

### Installer
- **Self-hosted routine scheduler** — replaces Claude Code Routines UI dependency. Three new files installed into `.darkflow.d/`: `darkflow-run.sh` (Bash dispatcher), `routines.yml` (cron schedule, generated and filtered by modules), `uninstall-scheduler.sh` (removes system job).
- **`--with-scheduler` / `--no-scheduler` flags** — install.sh optionally sets up a launchd job (macOS) or crontab entry (Linux) that fires the dispatcher every 15 min.
- **Interactive scheduler prompt** — during `install.sh`, user is asked whether to set up the system scheduler.
- **`slug=` field** added to `.darkflow` config — used to name the launchd/crontab job per-project to avoid collisions.
- **`update.sh`** — now copies `darkflow-run.sh` and `uninstall-scheduler.sh`; preserves existing `routines.yml`; adds `.darkflow.d/state/` and `.darkflow.d/*.log` to `.gitignore`.

### Docs
- **`routines/README.md`** — created (was missing, linked from README). Describes the dispatcher, YAML schedule, manual invocation, scheduler setup, and state files.
- **`routines/*.md`** — Configuration tables updated: `Schedule` → `Cron` (cron expression), `Always allowed: Act without asking` → `Permission mode: bypassPermissions`.
- **`README.md`** — Routines section rewritten for self-hosted scheduler model; added `--with-scheduler` flag docs and `darkflow-run.sh` usage examples.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-19

### Updated commands
- **Merged** `/darkflow:security-code-audit` + `/darkflow:security-runtime-audit` → `/darkflow:security-audit` — both called the same `/security-review` skill; one command is cleaner. Schedule: weekly Sun 3:00.

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-19

### New commands
- **10 new `/darkflow:*` routine commands** — each routine's prompt now lives in a slash command under `.claude/commands/darkflow/`:
  - `/darkflow:fix-issues` — pick up one approved issue, implement, close (reads `merge_strategy=` from `.darkflow` for PR vs direct)
  - `/darkflow:analytics-review` — PostHog + recent commits → GitHub issues + overview update
  - `/darkflow:observability-check` — errors / slow queries / latency → GitHub issues
  - `/darkflow:gsc-check` — Google Search Console → GitHub issues
  - `/darkflow:coolify-logs` — deployment log monitoring → fix errors
  - `/darkflow:deployment-failure` — diagnose and fix a failed deployment
  - `/darkflow:claude-md-update` — regenerate CLAUDE.md from codebase
  - `/darkflow:architecture-review` — architectural analysis → GitHub issues + overview update
  - `/darkflow:security-code-audit` — static `/security-review` → GitHub issues + overview update
  - `/darkflow:security-runtime-audit` — runtime `/security-review` → GitHub issues + overview update

### Updated routines
- **All 10 routine pages** — `Instructions` block collapsed to a single line (`/darkflow:<name>`); `After completing` section removed (moved into the command). Configuration, integrations, and notes preserved.
- **No more `[LANGUAGE]` / `[MAIN_BRANCH]` placeholders** — commands read `language=`, `branch=`, `merge_strategy=` from `.darkflow` automatically.

### Installer
- `install.sh` — fetches all 10 new command files; routine setup footer simplified to one-line prompts; CLAUDE.md `### Dark Flow commands` section updated to list routine commands.
- `update.sh` — fetches all 10 new command files on update; CLAUDE.md section updated to list all routine commands.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-05-18

### Installer
- **Renamed command** `/darkflow:new` → `/darkflow:add-issue` — clearer intent

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-05-18

### Installer
- **Removed command** `/darkflow:labels` — redundant; `/darkflow:update` already re-runs label setup as its first step

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-18

### Installer
- **Refactored commands** — `/darkflow <cmd>` split into namespaced subcommands: `/darkflow:new`, `/darkflow:install`, `/darkflow:update`; `/darkflow` now shows status only

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-17

### Installer
- **Updated command** `/darkflow:new` — interactive issue creator for manually identified bugs and features

---
